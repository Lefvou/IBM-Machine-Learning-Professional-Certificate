This [program](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-machine-learning) consists of 6 courses to develop working skills 
in the main areas of Machine Learning: **Supervised Learning**, **Unsupervised Learning**, **Deep Learning**, **Reinforcement Learning** 
and specialized topics such as **Time Series Analysis** and **Survival Analysis**.

Reduction of child mortality

One of the important data insight extracting methods in biomedical research are classification algorithms. Classification algorithms 
can be divided into two categories: binary and multi-class classifiers. The interest of this project is focused on a multi-class problem 
identifying and classifying Normal, Suspect, and Pathological fetuses.

## [Unsupervised Learning](link)🐱‍👤

New York Stock Exchange

Focus on clustering and apply unsupervised learning techniques to find the best candidate algorithm that accurately predicts 
wether a company has net profit or net loss. To do that, we will transform Net Income column into a binary representation 
of whether or not a company made profit, where 0 represents loss and 1 represents profit.

Covid 19 prediction

The corona-virus outbreak came to light on December, 2019 when China informed the World Health Organisation of a cluster of cases 
of pneumonia of an unknown cause in Wuhan City in Hubei Province. Subsequently the disease spread to more Provinces in China, and
to the rest of the world. The WHO has now declared it a pandemic.

Three models were created to find the most suitable for the specific problem:
• A simple convolutional neural network.
• The same architecture was used for the second model, but data augmentation techniques were
introduced, to find out if it will help to better accuracy and predictions.
• For the third model, transfer learning techniques were considered, by using a pretrained VGG-16 model (with data augmentation).

Data augmentation takes the approach of generating more training data from existing training
samples, by augmenting the samples via a number of random transformations that yield believablelooking images. 
The goal is that at training time, the model will not see the exact same picture twice. 
This helps to expose the model to more aspects of the data and generalize better. 
All images were resized to 128x128 for faster training
